<h1>EmployeeManager</h1>
<p>This is an app I built (am currently building) to sharpen my develepment skills.</p>
<h3>Key features:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Emplyee Management</li>
	<li>Time tracking</li>
	<li>Time off</li>
	<li>PTO</li>
	<li>Employee Scheduling</li>
	<li>Search for employees based off key features (name, time with company, etc.)</li>
	<li>Perfomance tracking</li>
	<li>Salary management</li>
</ul>

Business Logic: 
<ul>
    <li>Users have personal accounts and have permisions between employees and admins. The user model is also how all account veiws are formated.</li>
</ul>
